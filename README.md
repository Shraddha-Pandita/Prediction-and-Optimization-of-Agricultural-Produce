# Prediction-and-Optimization-of-Agricultural-Produce
Tn this project, Temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, and other conditions are analysed, and crop clusters are formed to help us understand which groups of crops require similar types of conditions to grow. K means clustering is used. After analysing the various climatic conditions required for different crops, multiclass classification is performed, and crop prediction based on given climatic conditions is concluded.
